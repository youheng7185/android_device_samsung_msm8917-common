## logger: Dump tool that automatically dumps logcat/kmsg while booting.
# It is common to miss boot time logs, since there is a lot of logs there on boot.
# So this dumps logs while boot, starts at post-fs-data, stops at sys.boot_completed=1
#
# This is selinux-safe (Enforcing OK) neverallow-safe (Passes neverallow)
# And user-build safe (Works)
#
